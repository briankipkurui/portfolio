# My Portfolio Website Project

## Project description

This is my portfolio website project. The website contains vital information about myself, such as my bio, education, skills, and previous projects. One thing I've learned from this project is how important it is to have a complete design before starting work on a project. It saves you a lot of time if you know exactly what you're working towards.
